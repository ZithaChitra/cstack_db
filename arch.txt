a query goes through a chain of components in order to retrieve
or modify data.

__front end__
1. tokenizer
2. parser
3. code genertaor

the input to the front-end is a SQL query. the output is sqlite
virtual machine bytecode (essentially a compiled program that can 
operate on the database).

__back end__
1. virtual machine
2. b-tree
3. pager
4. os interface

__virtual machine
    the virtual machine takes byte code generated by the front-end as 
    instructions. It can then perform operations on one or more tables
    or indexes, each of which is stored in a data strcure called a 
    B-tree. The VM is essentially a big switch statement on the 
    type of bytecode instruction.
